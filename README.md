- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lee!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m new to all of this, but I am trying. I am currently working on a Graphic Information Technology degree through Arizona State University. This will be my 4th degree, my second from ASU.
- ðŸ¥ƒ Iâ€™m a podcaster and host a drunk tv and film podcast. My podcast is called Line Drunk and I discuss shows with friends, interview special guests, and ask trivia questions about what we watched. It's been a passion of mine for over 4 years now and I have been able to interview some amazing people, not to mention create drinking games.

- ðŸ“« You can email me at llarimo1@asu.edu
- âš¡ Fun fact: I grew up in Vegas and had a very unique upbringing there, including getting tickets to shows from the entertainment director who is now an actor known for The Sopranos and Blue Bloods.
