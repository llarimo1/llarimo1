- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lee!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m new to all of this, but I am trying. I am currently working on a Graphic Information Technology degree through Arizona State University.
- ðŸ¥ƒ Iâ€™m a podcaster and host a drunk tv and film podcast. My podcast is called Line Drunk and I discuss shows with friends, interview special guests, and ask trivia questions about what we watched.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I grew up in Vegas and had a very unique upbringing there.
