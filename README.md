- 👋 Hi, I’m Lee!
- 👀 I’m new to all of this, but I am trying. I am currently working on a Graphic Information Technology degree through Arizona State University. This will be my 4th degree, my second from ASU. I currently drive for Uber and I still have available credit hours after getting a Film and Media Studies degree last year. I figured that I could continue to learn and do my own graphic design for my podcast and maybe it will lead to a job. Three degrees, including an MBA, and still job hunting. I have already learned a lot for coding and graphic design and I have only just begun.
- 🥃 I’m a podcaster and host a drunk tv and film podcast. My podcast is called Line Drunk and I discuss shows with friends, interview special guests, and ask trivia questions about what we watched. It's been a passion of mine for over 4 years now and I have been able to interview some amazing people, not to mention create drinking games.

- 🎲 Fun fact: I grew up in Vegas and had a very unique upbringing there, including getting tickets to shows from the entertainment director who is now an actor known for The Sopranos and Blue Bloods.
